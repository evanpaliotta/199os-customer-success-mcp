# Customer Success MCP Server - Development Plan to Production Readiness

**Plan Date:** October 10, 2025
**Current Status:** 52/100 (Not Production-Ready)
**Target Status:** 93/100 (Production-Ready, pricing parity with Marketing MCP)
**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks
**Estimated Effort:** 240-320 hours
**Budget:** $60,000 (Phase 1 Critical Parity)

---

## Executive Summary

### Current State (Audit Findings)

**Robustness Score:** 52/100 ❌ NOT Production-Ready

**Critical Gaps Identified:**
1. ❌ **ZERO Test Files** (Marketing: 123+, Sales: 50+, CS: 0)
2. ❌ **No Onboarding Wizard** (only empty stub vs full implementations in Sales/Marketing)
3. ❌ **All Platform Integrations Are Stubs** (4 mock integrations vs Marketing's 7 production APIs)
4. ❌ **Minimal Documentation** (3 placeholder files vs Marketing's 22 comprehensive guides)
5. ❌ **Basic Dockerfile** (single-stage, runs as root - security vulnerability)
6. ❌ **Missing Startup Validation** (Sales has 4-step validation, CS has basic version check only)
7. ❌ **No Performance Monitoring** (Sales/Marketing have comprehensive systems)
8. ❌ **Mock Data Only** (no real database integration)

**Value Disparity:** At the same price point, CS MCP currently delivers only **55% of the value** that Marketing MCP provides.

### Target State

**Robustness Score:** 90-95/100 ✅ Production-Ready

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ 50+ test files with >80% code coverage
- ✅ Full onboarding wizard (interactive setup for 4 platform integrations)
- ✅ 4 production-ready platform integrations (Zendesk, Intercom, Mixpanel, SendGrid)
- ✅ 15+ comprehensive documentation files (setup, API reference, troubleshooting)
- ✅ Multi-stage Dockerfile with security hardening (non-root user, minimal attack surface)
- ✅ 4-step startup validation (Python → Dependencies → Config → Health)
- ✅ Performance monitoring with Prometheus metrics
- ✅ Real database integration (PostgreSQL + Redis)
- ✅ CI/CD workflows (test, lint, build, deploy)
- ✅ Production deployment checklist

### Investment & Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Effort | Budget | Outcome |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|---------|
| **Phase 1: Critical Parity** | 6-8 weeks | 240-320h | $60K | Production-ready CS MCP |
| **Phase 2: Suite Standardization** | 2-3 weeks | 80-120h | $20K | Consistent RevOps Suite |
| **Phase 3: Integration** | 4-5 weeks | 160-200h | $35K | Unified RevOps platform |
| **TOTAL** | 12-16 weeks | 480-640h | $115K | Enterprise RevOps Suite |

**Critical Path:** Phase 1 must complete before CS MCP can launch at same price as Sales/Marketing MCPs.

---

## Phase 1: Critical Parity (6-8 weeks)

**Goal:** Bring CS MCP from 52/100 to 90/100 to justify pricing parity with Sales and Marketing MCPs.

#### Milestone 4.2: Docker & Infrastructure Hardening (Week 6, Days 1-2)
**Effort:** 12-16 hours

**Current State:** Basic single-stage Dockerfile, runs as root (security vulnerability)

**Target State:** Multi-stage Dockerfile with security hardening (ref: Marketing MCP `/Dockerfile`)

**Tasks:**
1. **Upgrade Dockerfile** (`/Dockerfile`)

   - [ ] **Implement multi-stage build** (ref: Marketing MCP `/Dockerfile`, 68 lines)
     - **Stage 1: Builder**
       - Use `python:3.11-slim` as base
       - Install build dependencies (gcc, postgresql-dev, etc.)
       - Copy requirements.txt
       - Install Python packages with `--no-cache-dir`
       - Create virtual environment
     - **Stage 2: Runtime**
       - Use `python:3.11-slim` as base (minimal attack surface)
       - Copy only installed packages from builder stage
       - Copy application code
       - DO NOT install build tools in runtime image

   - [ ] **Add non-root user** (CRITICAL SECURITY FIX)
     - Create `csops` user with UID 1000
     - Change ownership of app files to `csops:csops`
     - Switch to `csops` user with `USER csops`
     - NEVER run as root in production

   - [ ] **Harden security**
     - Add `LABEL` metadata (version, maintainer, description)
     - Set `HEALTHCHECK` to test server responsiveness (not just `sys.exit(0)`)
     - Use `COPY --chown=csops:csops` to set ownership during copy
     - Set read-only filesystem where possible
     - Drop unnecessary capabilities

   - [ ] **Optimize image size**
     - Remove build dependencies from runtime stage
     - Clear package manager cache
     - Use `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files (tests, docs, .git)
     - Target final image size: <500MB (currently ~800MB)

   - [ ] **Improve health check**
     - Replace `python -c "import sys; sys.exit(0)"` with real health check
     - Test server is listening on port 8080
     - Test database connectivity
     - Test Redis connectivity
     - Return proper exit code (0 = healthy, 1 = unhealthy)

2. **Update docker-compose.yml**

   - [ ] Add health checks to postgres and redis services
   - [ ] Add `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy`
   - [ ] Add restart policies for all services
   - [ ] Add resource limits (CPU, memory)
   - [ ] Add logging configuration (JSON driver)
   - [ ] Add network isolation (internal network for db/redis)

3. **Create additional Docker files**

   - [ ] **`.dockerignore`** (ref: Marketing MCP `/.dockerignore`)
     - Exclude tests/, docs/, .git/, *.pyc, __pycache__/
     - Exclude .env (secrets should not be in image)
     - Exclude logs/, data/ (runtime directories)

   - [ ] **`docker-compose.test.yml`**
     - Test environment with test database
     - Runs pytest in container
     - Used by CI/CD pipeline

   - [ ] **`docker-compose.prod.yml`**
     - Production-ready configuration
     - Uses external database (not container)
     - Adds Nginx reverse proxy
     - Adds TLS termination

4. **Test Docker setup**
   - [ ] Build multi-stage image: `docker build -t cs-mcp:test .`
   - [ ] Verify non-root user: `docker run cs-mcp:test whoami` (should output "csops")
   - [ ] Verify image size: `docker images cs-mcp:test` (should be <500MB)
   - [ ] Test health check: `docker inspect --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}' <container>`
   - [ ] Test docker-compose: `docker-compose up -d` and verify all services healthy

**Reference Files:**
- Marketing MCP: `/Dockerfile` (68 lines) - **PRIMARY REFERENCE** for multi-stage build
- Sales MCP: `/Dockerfile` (52 lines) - good security practices
- Marketing MCP: `/docker-compose.yml` (91 lines) - comprehensive orchestration

**Security Improvements:**
| Issue | Current | Target |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Runs as root** | ❌ Yes (UID 0) | ✅ No (UID 1000, user `csops`) |
| **Build stage in runtime** | ❌ Single stage | ✅ Multi-stage (builder + runtime) |
| **Image size** | ~800MB | <500MB |
| **Health check** | Fake (always passes) | Real (tests server + database) |
| **Build tools in runtime** | ❌ Yes (gcc, etc.) | ✅ No (removed) |

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Multi-stage Dockerfile builds successfully
- [ ] Image runs as non-root user (UID 1000)
- [ ] Image size reduced to <500MB
- [ ] Health check tests real server health
- [ ] docker-compose starts all services with health checks
- [ ] Security scan passes (e.g., `docker scan cs-mcp:test` with 0 critical vulnerabilities)

#### Milestone 4.3: Performance Monitoring (Week 6, Days 3-4)
**Effort:** 12-16 hours

**Current State:** No performance monitoring

**Target State:** Prometheus metrics + performance logging (ref: Sales MCP `/src/monitoring/performance_monitor.py`)

3. **Create performance dashboard** (Grafana)

   - [ ] Create `docs/operations/GRAFANA_DASHBOARD.json`
   - [ ] Panel 1: Tool execution rate (requests/sec)
   - [ ] Panel 2: Tool execution duration (p50, p95, p99)
   - [ ] Panel 3: Error rate (errors/sec)
   - [ ] Panel 4: Database query duration
   - [ ] Panel 5: Platform API call duration

**Effort:** 80-120 hours per server (160-240 total)
**Budget:** $30,000

### For Sales MCP

1. **Improve .env.example** (backport from CS MCP)
   - CS MCP has most detailed .env.example (242 lines with extensive comments)
   - Sales MCP .env.example is very comprehensive (476 lines) but could adopt CS organization

2. **Add comprehensive test coverage**
   - Sales MCP has ~50 tests (good), but needs more
   - Target: 80%+ coverage (currently ~60-65%)

3. **Enhance documentation**

---

## Phase 4: Suite Integration (4-5 weeks)

**Goal:** Make the three servers work together seamlessly

**Effort:** 160-200 hours
**Budget:** $35,000

### Tasks

1. **Shared credential vault**
   - Problem: Customer configures Salesforce credentials in Sales MCP, HubSpot in Marketing, and both in CS → duplication
   - Solution: Shared encrypted credential vault (Redis or separate service)
   - All three servers can read/write credentials
   - Single setup wizard configures all three

2. **Event bus (cross-server workflows)**
   - Use Redis Pub/Sub or RabbitMQ
   - Examples:
     - Sales MCP: Deal closed → Marketing MCP: Add to customer nurture campaign → CS MCP: Create onboarding plan
     - CS MCP: Churn risk identified → Sales MCP: Create retention opportunity
     - Marketing MCP: Lead qualified → Sales MCP: Create opportunity
   - Define event schema
   - Implement event publishers/subscribers

3. **Unified RevOps dashboard**
   - Single Grafana dashboard showing metrics from all three servers
   - Panels:
     - Total pipeline value (Sales)
     - Marketing qualified leads (Marketing)
     - Customer health scores (CS)
     - Churn risk (CS)
     - Retention rate (CS)
     - Deal velocity (Sales)
     - Campaign performance (Marketing)
   - Cross-server insights (e.g., "Which marketing campaigns lead to highest health scores?")

4. **Shared data models**
   - Extract common models (Client, Company, Contact) to shared library
   - All three servers import from shared library
   - Ensures data consistency across servers

5. **Multi-server onboarding wizard**
   - Single wizard that configures all three servers
   - Detects which servers are installed
   - Configures shared credentials once
   - Configures server-specific settings

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Shared credential vault working
- [ ] 5+ cross-server workflows implemented
- [ ] Unified dashboard created
- [ ] Multi-server wizard working

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items

1. **Platform API Changes**
   - **Risk:** Zendesk/Intercom/Mixpanel/SendGrid APIs change, breaking integrations
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Use official client libraries (they handle API changes)
     - Pin library versions in requirements.txt
     - Add API version checks in integration code
     - Monitor vendor changelogs

2. **Database Performance**
   - **Risk:** Database becomes bottleneck at scale
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Add indexes on all frequently queried fields
     - Use connection pooling (already planned)
     - Implement caching (Redis, already planned)
     - Test with realistic data volumes (10,000+ customers)

3. **Test Coverage Gaps**
   - **Risk:** 80% coverage but critical bugs in untested 20%
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Focus testing on high-risk areas (health scoring, churn prediction, integrations)
     - Add integration tests with real APIs (use sandbox accounts)
     - Add end-to-end tests for common workflows
     - Manual QA testing in staging

4. **Timeline Slippage**
   - **Risk:** Phase 1 takes longer than 6-8 weeks
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Prioritize P0 items (tests, integrations, onboarding)
     - P1 items can slip to Phase 1.5 (CI/CD, advanced monitoring)
     - Track progress weekly (update todo list)
     - Cut scope if needed (e.g., fewer documentation files, fewer tests)

### Medium-Risk Items

1. **Documentation Quality**
   - **Risk:** Documentation incomplete or unclear
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Have non-technical person review documentation
     - Test setup guides with fresh environment
     - Collect feedback from beta customers

2. **Docker Image Size**
   - **Risk:** Image size >500MB despite multi-stage build
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Use Alpine base image (smaller than Debian slim)
     - Remove unnecessary packages
     - Use .dockerignore aggressively

3. **Platform Integration Rate Limits**
   - **Risk:** Hit rate limits during load testing or production
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Implement exponential backoff (already planned)
     - Add queue for API calls (optional, if needed)
     - Cache API responses (already planned)
     - Document rate limits in integration guides
